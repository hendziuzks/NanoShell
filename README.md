# NanoShell for Arduino

WARNING: requires 1.5k of RAM, so be careful about which processor you put it on!
Technically, it should work on a MEGA 2560, but I haven't tried it yet.

Source and pictures can be found here and, hopefully, only here.

It uses Bodmer/TFT_ST7735 (and possibly adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) libraries.
It also uses EEPROM.h and SPI.h.
